# General Project Structure Guide

This document outlines the main structural components of the `trapdash` project.

*   **Main Entry Point**: The primary HTML file for the game is `[index.html](mdc:index.html)`. It should contain the basic HTML structure and the container for the Phaser game.
*   **Implementation Tracking**: The `[IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md](mdc:IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md)` file is used to track the progress of game development phases and features. All new features or changes to existing ones should be reflected here.
*   **JavaScript Logic**: All game-related JavaScript code is located in the `[js/](mdc:js/)` directory. Refer to `javascript_organization.mdc` for detailed structure within this directory.
*   **Styling**: CSS styles are located in the `[css/](mdc:css/)` directory, primarily in `[css/style.css](mdc:css/style.css)`.
*   **Assets**: Game assets such as images and sounds are stored in the `[assets/](mdc:assets/)` directory. Refer to `assets_and_css.mdc` for more details.
