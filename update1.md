**1. Enhanced Player Feedback & Game "Feel":**
    *   **Particle Effects:**
        *   **Jump Dust:** Small puff of dust when the player/bot jumps.
        *   **Landing Dust/Impact:** Similar effect when landing.
        *   **Speed Boost Trail:** Particles trailing behind the player when speed boost is active.
        *   **Shield Activation/Break:** Visual shimmer when shield activates, and a small "shatter" effect when it breaks.
        *   **Power-Up Collection:** A burst of particles when a power-up box is collected.
        *   *Phaser has a built-in particle system. AI Prompt: "How do I create a simple dust puff particle effect in Phaser 3 when a sprite lands?"*
    *   **Screen Shake (Subtle):**
        *   A very slight, short screen shake when hitting an obstacle (if not game over) or when a powerful event happens.
        *   *Phaser Camera Effect: `this.cameras.main.shake(duration, intensity);`*
    *   **Character Animations (if not already detailed):**
        *   Ensure smooth transitions between running, jumping, falling, and potentially a "hit" animation.
        *   *AI Prompt: "Show me how to define and play spritesheet animations in Phaser 3 for 'run', 'jump', and 'fall' states."*

**2. UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   **Clearer Power-Up Indication:**
        *   Besides an icon, maybe a timer bar or visual effect on the player sprite indicating an active power-up and its remaining duration.
    *   **Improved Race Position Display:** Make it prominent and easy to read.
    *   **Visual Countdown at Start:** "3... 2... 1... GO!" using Phaser Text objects and tweens or timers.
    *   **More Engaging Game Over Screen:**
        *   Show final score/time.
        *   Clear "Retry" and "Main Menu" buttons.
        *   Perhaps a simple "Well Done!" or "Try Again!" message.

**3. More Dynamic Obstacles & Level Variety:**
    *   **Moving Obstacles:**
        *   Platforms that move up/down or left/right that players need to time their jumps for.
        *   *Use Phaser tweens or physics velocity on obstacle sprites.*
    *   **"Destructible" Obstacles (Visual Only):** Obstacles that look like they break or react when hit (even if the gameplay effect is just a stun).
    *   **Varied Obstacle Patterns:** Instead of purely random placement, create predefined "chunks" or patterns of obstacles that are then randomly selected and placed to create more interesting and learnable challenges.
        *   *You can manage this in your `ObstacleManager.js`.*

**4. Advanced Bot AI Behavior:**
    *   **Power-Up Usage Strategy:**
        *   Make bots "smarter" about when to use specific power-ups (e.g., use shield if another bot is nearby with an offensive power-up, use speed boost on long clear stretches).
    *   **Obstacle Avoidance Refinement:**
        *   Can bots time their jumps better? Do they sometimes make "mistakes"?
    *   **"Personalities" (Simple):**
        *   One bot might be more aggressive with offensive power-ups.
        *   Another might be more defensive or better at pure platforming.
        *   *(This can be done by having slightly different parameters or decision trees in your `Bot.js` class for different bot instances).*

**5. Additional Power-Ups (Choose 1-2 to expand):**
    *   **Offensive Power-Up (if not already robust):**
        *   **Lightning Zap (Targeted):** Zaps the opponent directly in front, briefly stunning them. (Requires targeting logic).
        *   **Droppable Trap:** Leaves a trap behind that stuns the next character to hit it.
    *   **Utility Power-Up:**
        *   Shuriken: when selected, a shuriken deploys in front of the player /bot but be careful as  it might bounce off the wall and come back

**6. Scoring System & Local Leaderboard:**
    *   **Refined Scoring:** Score based on distance, power-ups collected, opponents overtaken, time to finish.
    *   **Local Leaderboard:**
        *   On the Game Over screen, if the player gets a high score, prompt for a name (3 initials).
        *   Save top 5-10 scores using browser `localStorage`.
        *   Display the leaderboard on the Main Menu or a separate Leaderboard scene.
        *   *AI Prompt: "How do I use localStorage in JavaScript to save and retrieve an array of high scores for a Phaser game?"*

**Order of Implementation for New Features:**

I'd suggest this rough order:

1.  **Character Animations & Basic Particle Effects:** Immediate visual impact and "game feel."
2.  **UI/UX Improvements:** Countdown, clearer Game Over screen.
3.  **Scoring System & Local Leaderboard:** Gives players a goal.
4.  **Advanced Bot AI (Iterative):** Make the race more dynamic.
5.  **More Dynamic Obstacles / Varied Patterns.**
6.  **Additional Power-Ups.**

**When to Consider the Mobile Wrapper (CapacitorJS):**

Once you feel the game is:
*   **Fun and engaging as a web game.**
*   **Relatively bug-free in its core loop.**
*   **Has a decent amount of content/polish (several of the features above implemented).**
