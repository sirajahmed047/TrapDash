*   [X] **Ground Check:**
    *   [X] Ensure ground object is a static physics body and player/bot collide with it (`this.physics.add.collider(this.player, groundObject);`). `this.player.body.onFloor()` will work.

    *   [X] Manually place a few "wall" obstacles.
    *   [X] Player/Bot collides with walls: `this.physics.add.collider(this.player, this.walls);`.
*   [X] **Obstacle Implementation (Gaps):**
    *   [X] Design track sections with gaps (no ground object in these areas). Player/bot must jump.
*   [X] **Player-Obstacle Collision Response:**
    *   [X] Implement collision callback when player hits a "wall": `this.physics.add.collider(this.player, this.walls, handlePlayerHitObstacle, null, this);`.

*   [X] **AI Bot Jump Logic (in scene's `update` or Bot class):**
    *   [X] Implement logic to detect upcoming obstacles (e.g., raycasting, checking distance to nearest obstacle).
    *   [X] If obstacle detected and bot is on floor, make bot jump: `if (shouldJump && this.bot.body.onFloor()) { this.bot.body.setVelocityY(JUMP_VELOCITY); }`.

    *   [X] Implement collection logic: Mystery boxes give random powerup when touched.
    *   [X] Persistent mystery boxes: Boxes remain active and can give powerups to all characters.
    *   [X] Cooldown system: 1-second cooldown per character to prevent spam collection.
*   [X] **Random Power-Up System:**
    *   [X] Implement `getRandomPowerup()` function to select from available powerup types.
